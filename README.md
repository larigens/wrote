## Installation

### Cloning the Repository

Click `<> code` - the green button. After clicking, in the local tab, copy the SSH key. Open the terminal in your Macbook or [git bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads), if you have Windows/Linux, and type:

```bash
git clone [paste ssh key]
```

I would recommend downloading [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) to edit the code locally. If you need more information on how to clone a repository, [click here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)!

### Prerequisites

This package requires you to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), npm and [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/) installed on your machine. You can install these by running the code below on your terminal:

For `npm`

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
```

For `Node.js`

```bash
npm i node@lts
```

For `Express.js`

```bash
npm i express
```

### Setting Up

Open the project in VS Code and make sure you are in the directory of this application and then type the command below on your terminal:

```bash
npm i
```


```bash
npm i ejs
```

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance:

<img src="./public/assets/images/demo.png" alt="App Screenshot" width="700px" height="342px" />

## Usage

Launch the application by entering the command below on your terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

After launching the application, the user will be presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. If the link is clicked, it will display a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note‚Äôs text in the right-hand column

WHEN I enter a new note title and the note‚Äôs text
THEN a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page
WHEN I click on the Save icon
THEN the new note I have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes
WHEN I click on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column
THEN that note appears in the right-hand column
WHEN I click on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page
THEN I am presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note‚Äôs text in the right-hand column

## Tests

### Prerequisites

To test this application, you will need to install [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest).

```bash
npm i jest
```

Then, add Jest as a dev dependency to the project by running:

```bash
npm install --save-dev jest
```

### Running Tests

Open your terminal, make sure you are in the directory of this application and type the command below:

```bash
npx jest
```

You should see a result like the following:

<img src="./dist/assets/images/test-demo.png" alt="Test Screenshot" width="250px" height="160px" />

All tests passed, and all four Test Suites ran without errors.
